<p>Building a database website from scratch has been highly challenging and highly informative. I live with dozens of open browser tabs doing research at every few lines of code. I see this as a powerful opportunity for growth. One of the most valuable aspects of SQL theory is planning down the road. The process of diagramming and modeling, while at first laborious and seemingly pointless, is remarkably useful once later stages of development roll around. There were many points at which I needed to implement a process and realized that forethought from months ago saved me having to rebuild the whole database. Other times there were features that I wanted to implement, but couldn't without starting from scratch. Using this project as my Beta has advanced my expertise in both SQL, coding, and project management. </p>
<p>I want to thank my instructors for allowing me to tackle this project. I had some trepidation that the goals would be sufficient. But, having walked (at times slogged) through the process, I have now realized what my instructors have: building a functional website with databases is a tall order. </p>
<p>I also want to thank two services which I used: lipsum.org for making free content generation. And Chartjs.org for making such beautiful and interactive javascript charts. Their free API and excellent documentation is unparalleled.</p>
