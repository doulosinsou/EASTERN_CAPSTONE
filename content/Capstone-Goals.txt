<p>Fundamentally, my purpose is to create a functional website using a database for all content. The website hosts multiple blogs (called topics) by multiple authors and contributors. Viewers can access public topics, subscription topics, and private topics based on their level of authentication. The site will display sufficient pages and links to navigate content and authors, including available topics, tags, and posts.</p>
<p>Viewers will be able to simulate roles and logins through a dropdown at the top of the site. By selecting their role, they see what one may see under a similar logged-in experience.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a dashboard for administrators to see visualized stats from visits, revenue, and subscribers. The public viewers of this project app will not be able to view these dashboards unless they switch to administrator.</p> 
<p>I also feature a simplistic search page, to find content in the blogs and display links.</p>
<p>This project is inspired by my previous work in web development and web hosting. I have desired for many years now to create my own template-style service for my clients. Such a project as this can easily be converted into my actual website creation workflow. I will not create the UX for user management for this project. I will focus instead on Database creation, access, and functional server delivery. </p>
<p>At the time of submission, the server must be locally hosted, although the database is successfully hosted through my own shared servers. The video walkthrough will show the functional features of the website while running on my machine. When uploading projects of this sort, there are too many bugs related to server requirements and malware protection for me to make part of this submission. However, once sufficient bugs are worked out, it will be made public as a portfolio through my personal website.</p>
