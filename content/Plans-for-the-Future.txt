<p>My plans for this project are not to put it on the back shelf. Instead, I will continue to create solutions/patches for each of the bugs represented above. I will alter some of the tables to allow for more data to be collected in the future. I also want to create a more robust network of selects, inserts, and updates. My current process is rather chaotic. With a more streamlined modularized approach, I can deploy the application swiftly and efficiently while also making it more legible. Fully commented code is a highly lacking part of this current submission. The end goal is to use this platform to build websites for clients with yet to be built UX for administrators/authors/contributors. </p>
